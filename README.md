# What is this?

What you see is a repository of my solutions for algorithmic problems presented during the Algorithms and Data Structure course (further referred to as "ASD) at the Faculty of Mathematics, Informatics and Mechanics of the University of Warsaw (further referred to as "MIM UW").

# What is the difficulty of presented problems?

All showcased projects are either exam tasks (here I have speciffically chosen problems that are identified as more advanced) [https://szkopul.edu.pl/c/asd-playground/p/]
or homework assignments [https://szkopul.edu.pl/c/laboratorium-z-asd-2022/dashboard/].

# What about correctness of that algorithms?

All presented here solutions passed 100% tests on szkopu≈Ç server and thus are correct. 

# How to read solutions? 

Every solution will contain description of the problem (see description.txt), documentation of implemented functions (see documention.h file), implementation file (see main.cpp) 
and local tests (see local_tests.cpp).

# What programming language I use for writing solutions?

Most of the time I use C++ (g++:8.3 std=c++17) for implementing algorithms.
