# What is this?

What you see is a repository of my solutions for algorithmic problems presented during the Algorithms and Data Structure course (further referred to as "ASD) at the Faculty of Mathematics, Informatics and Mechanics of the University of Warsaw (further referred to as "MIM UW").

# What is the difficulty of presented problems?

All showcased projects are either exam tasks (here I have speciffically chosen problems that are identified as more advanced) [https://szkopul.edu.pl/c/asd-playground/p/]
or homework assignments [https://szkopul.edu.pl/c/laboratorium-z-asd-2022/dashboard/].

# How to read solutions? 

Every problem has its own folder. Every solution will contain description of the problem (see description.txt), explanation of the implementation / algorithm
(see before_implementation.txt), implementation file (see main.cpp)  and local tests (see local_tests.txt).

# What about correctness of that algorithms?

All presented here solutions which are contained in main.cpp file passed 100% tests on szkopu≈Ç server and thus are correct. If in some folder will be another .cpp file with  different implementation, then this solution could show another useful data structure which potentially solve the problem but it may be to slow to pass all tests. 
All information about additional .cpp files with different implementation is in before_implementation.txt.

# What programming language I use for writing solutions?

Most of the time I use C++ (g++:8.3 std=c++17) for implementing algorithms.

# How to compile programs?

To compile programs You need to download the code from main.cpp to Your machine (with installed C++) and run it there on Your own tests or on my tests which are 
in the local_tests.txt (in that file You will find different input and for each such input there will be also the correct answer Your program should return).
