-----------------------------------------------------------------
ASD, correctional exam. Available memory: 256 MB.

-Problem description:

There are n intervals [a_i, b_i] with multiplicities. The multiplicity of i-th interval is k_i. For any integer x we define kro(x) as the sum of multiplicities of 
such intervals [a_i,b_i] which contain x. Your question is to find out the number of unordered pairs {x,y}, such that kro(x) > 0, kro(y) > 0 and kro(x) != kro(y).

-Input:

In the first line of standard input there is one integer n (1 <= n <= 500 000) - the number of intervals. The next n rows contains the description of intervals, it is
every row has 3 integer numbers a_i, b_i, k_i (1<= a_i <= b_i <= 10^9, 1 <= k_i <= 1000), separated by space charakter, describing respectively the interval [a_i,b_i]
and his multiplicity k_i.

-Output:

Your program has to print on standard output flow one integer number - the number of unordered pairs satisfying the condition described in problem description.

-Example:

For an input:                 the correct answer is:
3			      9
1 3 2
3 4 3
3 5 1

Explanation: All interested pairs are: {1,3}, {1,4}, {1,5}, {2,3}, {2,4}, {2,5}, {3,4}, {3,5}, {4,5}.
